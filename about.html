        <h2>Our Innovation</h2>
        <p>This innovation is able to provide clinical benefits to a large range of people suffering from hearing issues. We can directly address clinical hearing issues, starting with smaller cases of misophonia and extending to the larger market of 1.5 billion people who suffer from hearing issues.</p>

        <p><strong>Understanding Misophonia</strong></p>
        <p>Misophonia is a disorder in which a certain frequency or type of sound triggers a neurological reaction resulting in a disproportionately emotional response. The types of sounds that can trigger this are often high-frequency noises. Any noise can trigger a condition of misophonia, but typically these are sounds that are normally found mildly irritating, such as sniffling, coughing, or eating. It is suggested that one-fifth of people will experience misophonia for some duration of their life at different degrees of severity<sup>[1]</sup>. The current solutions for misophonia each have some drawbacks and can be improved upon. White noise generators are expensive and are not always effective at canceling out certain noises if at loud amplitudes or close proximity.</p>

        <p><strong>Reverbrix's Solution</strong></p>
        <p>Reverbrixâ€™s focus on selective auditory management allows it to be different from other current devices. Existing devices such as hearing aids and white noise generators usually lack the customization needed for people with specific auditory sensitivities. While hearing aids amplify all sounds indiscriminately, white noise generators try to mask unwanted noises without effectively addressing high-frequency irritants or maintaining awareness of environmental surroundings.</p>

        <p>Reverbrix, however, offers frequency-isolating noise cancellation and phrase recognition technology, which can filter out disruptive sounds while still allowing users to hear important background noises. This means that Reverbrix will not only help people with misophonia but also other individuals with mild hearing impairments. Furthermore, Reverbrix prioritizes comfort and appeal for the user, making it easy for prolonged daily use by consumers.</p>
